Nowadays professional contacts are large in number which is difficult to manage. 
Handling a large number of contacts by a professional manually is complex.
The mini project ‘Contact Management’ is the sample project for managing contact details.
The project aims at developing contact management systems using the C language that enables an organization to maintain its library.
The project demonstrates the creation of a user interface of a system, without the use of C Graphics library. 
The application uses basic C function to generate menus, show message boxes and print text on the screen. 
To display customized text with colors and fonts according to application requirements, functions have been created in the application, which fetch the exact v
ideo memory addresses of a target location, to write text at a particular location. 
The application also implements the concept of structures to define the contact items. It also effectively applies the various C concepts such as file operations, looping and branching constructs and string manipulation functions.
